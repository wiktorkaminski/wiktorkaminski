### You're awesome! You've just found my GitHub profile :relaxed:

So, if you're here let me quickly introduce myself: 
I'm a civil engineer, working as a... civil engineer and loss adjuster :smile:. But I'm sure that it will change soon! Currently I'm working to reach my new career goals. All my life computers, games and various programs were my best companions. Finally, I've decided to follow my passion and I've started to code. 

I want to become a Java Developer. Yes! To become *The Java Developer*! I'm really looking forward to it. 

Recently I've finished my first Java course and still working to improve my skills in:
- [x] Java ![Java favicon](img/java.ico)
- [x] Spring ![Spring favicon](img/spring.ico) & Hibernate
- [x] mySQL ![mySQL favicon](img/MySQL.ico)
- [x] JavaScript ![JavaScript favicon](img/JS.ico)

Have a look at my repo, if you want to. I am aware, that it is just a newbie's code :wink:, but I'm constantly working to improve myself.
