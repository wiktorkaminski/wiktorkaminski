### You're awesome! You've just found my GitHub profile :relaxed:

So, if you're here let me quick introduce myself: 
I'm a civil engineer, working as a... civil engineer and loss adjuster :smile:. But, not for long from now! Currently I'm working to reach my new approach. Whole my life computers, games and various programs were my best companions. Finally I have decided to follow my passions and I started to code. 

I want to become a Java Developer. Yes! To become *The Java Developer*! I'm really excited that it would happen. 

Recently I've finished my first Java course and still working to improve my skills in:
- [x] Java ![Java favicon](img/java.ico)
- [x] Spring ![Spring favicon](img/spring.ico) & Hibernate
- [x] mySQL ![mySQL favicon](img/MySQL.ico)
- [x] JavaScript ![JavaScript favicon](img/JS.ico)

Have a look in my repo, if you want. I am aware, that it is just a newbie's code :wink:, but I'm constantly working to improve myself.
